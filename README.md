# pointinator
discord bot that accepts commands from chat and tallies points and calculates reward tiers

# hi helm
so basically you `git clone https://github.com/AisiYidingbai/pointinator.git` this repo, install python, and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`, discord.py, numpy, and pandas, and run it.

(to update requirements.txt use pipreqs (`pip install pipreqs`) inside project folder)

copy-paste the secret key into `secret.py`, bai'll tell you my secrets if you ask nicely

the syntax is `python pointinator.py -o /path/to/files/` and you'll see it up in discord automatically

you need to specify a path where the sheets will live with `-o`, if the sheets aren't there already then pointinator will make them
