# pointinator
discord bot that accepts commands from chat and tallies points and calculates reward tiers

# hi helm
so basically you git pull this repo, install python, discord.py, numpy, and pandas, and run it. you'll see it up in discord automatically

you need the secret key which i'll tell you, specify the keyfile with -k

you need to specify a path where the sheets will live with -o

`git clone https://github.com/AisiYidingbai/pointinator.git`

`pip install discord.py numpy pandas`

`python pointinator.py -k /path/to/secret/key -o /path/to/files/`
